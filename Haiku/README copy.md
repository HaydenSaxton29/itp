I started by opening terminal and searching for a haiku. 

Then I found one and copied it. 

Then I wrote -o .aiff -v "samantha" "I write, erase, rewrite
Erase again, and then A poppy blooms." 

It did not work because it was the wrong order. 

So then I went to the [GitHub Canvas thing](https://github.com/rdwrome/261fa25/tree/main/01Git%26Shell)  and found the right command. 

I typed in "say -v "Samantha" "-o .aiff -v "samantha" "I write, erase, rewrite Erase again, and then A poppy blooms." -o Haiku.aiff
