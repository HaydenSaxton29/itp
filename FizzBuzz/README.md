First I copied the code from the codealong used to print numbers in order. 

Then I added the if conditions in order to make the fizz and the buzz and the fizzbuzz apear. 

  I realized that fizz and buzz were printing after the numbers instead of replacing them
  
  I then remembered about the else if condition thing and added that to the "Fizz" and "Buzz". But I still have to figure out how to replace the numbers.
  
  After I got that I started just moving around the console.log. I first just moved it to end but that just made the Fizz stuff come before the number instead of after it. 
  
  I then realized that I just needed to add an else to the number console.log so it would only print if the other conditions weren't met. After that there were errors so I changed around the curly brackets until it worked
