# Problems 

Copied and pasted the beggining of the code from the sample website

Using link to from the sample website so it didn't work but then we also copied the file and altered it which fixed it

We had a formatting problem where the text for one paragraph wasn't coming up in the same format as the other paragraphs so we checked what was different about it and it ended up being that the headers were labeled wrong. 

# Assesment

To be completely honest I did not contribute as much as Eli or George, I found the image that we used and also the gif and did the code for them. I tried very hard to understand what was happening and help but I couldn't figure it out. I helped out a little bit with the debugging and added examples our shared google docs. 

Eli and George did the majority of the work with the coding/formatting and Andrew did a little bit too like the name and his paragraph.
