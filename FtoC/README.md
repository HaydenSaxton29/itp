I started by writing let f = 99

Then I put in the equation as let c = (f - 32) * 5 / 9 and console.log(c);
This worked without any problems.

But when I tried to do the prompt I wrote let f = prompt("What temperature is the weather today"). 

When I typed 99 into the prompt it outputted NaN.

I then asked for your help and you showed me that the prompt had to be defined before the equation, which makes sense because the code is being read from top to bottom.
