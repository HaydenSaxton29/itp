## 1 Paragraph Overview

The goal will be to make a 8-16 step sequencer in p5.js using one or multiple of their monosynth objects. I think that part will be fairly easy because there are multiple examples of that already. I think the hard part will be making a parameter like the pitch or filter cutoff sequanceable. I want it to work kind of like the moog DFAM in that there are knobs per step which affect a parameter. 

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

No

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
